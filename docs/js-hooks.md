# JavaScript Hooks

It is possible to extend PowerTunnel functionality using hooks written in JavaScript.  
To add hooks support, you need to install [PowerTunnel-Hooks](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Hooks) plugin.  
Hooks are slower and have less functionality than plugins, so if you need to develop a stable and powerful solution rather than a quick and dirty extension to test specific functionality at the moment, please consider developing a plugin using the SDK.
